# Game-Data-Analysis
Consolidate data from various sources into a Google Spreadsheet with three sheets. Calculate metrics like total revenue, paid user count, and conversion rates. Analyze age demographics and revenue variations between games. Test hypotheses and provide recommendations to game managers based on the analysis.

# Task: Game Data Analysis

## Description

Gathering data from various sources into one Google Spreadsheet file with three sheets: games_paid_users, games, games_payments. Calculating the following metrics for each game listed in the games sheet:

- Total revenue — total revenue from the game.
- Paid users count — total number of paying users.
- CR to Paid — conversion from users to paying users in percentage.
- ARPPU — average revenue per paying user.
- Average Age (paid users) — average age of paying users.
- Median age (paid users) — median age of paying users (calculated overall for all games, not for each game separately).
- Minimum age (paid users) — minimum age of paying users.
- Maximum age (paid users) — maximum age of paying users.

Adding columns to the games spreadsheet with the following data:

- Total revenue — total revenue from the game.
- Paid users count — total number of paying users.
- CR to Paid — conversion from users to paying users in percentage.
- ARPPU — average revenue per paying user.
- Average Age (paid users) — average age of paying users.
- Median age (paid users) — median age of paying users (calculated overall for all games, not for each game separately).
- Minimum age (paid users) — minimum age of paying users.
- Maximum age (paid users) — maximum age of paying users.

Adding a "Total" row with the total values of each metric for all products simultaneously. Formatting tables for readability.

Answering the following questions:

- Why games labeled with numbers 1 and 2 may have lower CR to Paid conversion?
- What could be the reason for the difference in ARPPU between games?
- How would you test your hypotheses?
- What recommendations would you give to the managers of game number 2?
